**DOMAIN**: MACHINE LEARNING  
**DURATION**: 4 WEEKS  
**MENTOR**: NEELA SANTHOSH  

## DESCRIPTION  
In this project, I built and visualized a **Decision Tree Classification Model** using the Scikit-learn library in Python.  
The goal was to classify or predict outcomes based on patterns in the chosen dataset.  
The dataset was preprocessed, analyzed, and then used to train a decision tree model that could make predictions on unseen data.

## TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED:
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used as the development environment for coding, visualization, and documentation.  
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)**: Library used for building the decision tree model (`DecisionTreeClassifier`) and for splitting the dataset.  
- **Pandas**: For data loading and manipulation.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing the data and the decision tree.  
- **plot_tree**: To visualize the structure of the decision tree.
